# deep-learning-challenge
# Background
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, you have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

    * EIN and NAME—Identification columns
    * APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
    * AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
    * CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
    * USE_CASE—Use case for funding
    * ORGANIZATION—Organization type
    * STATUS—Active status
    * INCOME_AMT—Income classification
    * SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
    * ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
    * IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

# Steps to Follow (instructions already included in the building process)
## Step 1: Preprocess the Data
Using your knowledge of Pandas and scikit-learn’s StandardScaler(), you’ll need to preprocess the dataset. This step prepares you for Step 2, where you'll compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model.
## Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, you’ll design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. You’ll need to think about how many inputs there are before determining the number of neurons and layers in your model. Once you’ve completed that step, you’ll compile, train, and evaluate your binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy.
## Step 3: Optimize the Model
Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, optimize your model to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.
## Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model
